```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Carl DeBoer suggested mashing datasets together and plotting a big PCA. I think I'll first try this with A1 and TE for LUAD.

# Multi-Dataset PCA (DeBoer's suggestion)

## Read in data
```{r}

## Read in the A1 normalized expression data
A1_exprs <- read.table("../../2_Outputs/2_Airway_expression/A1_exprs_20250403.txt", sep = " ")

## Read in the TE normalized expression data
TE_exprs <- read.table("../../2_Outputs/3_Tumor_expression/TE_data_20250403.txt", sep = " ")

```
